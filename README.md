# Suleis
## Intelligent IoT Lighting Controller


Suleis lets you control your addressable LED strips from an easy-to-use web interface. It supports lighting both solid and moving (dynamic) lighting patterns, and can show multiple patterns per LED strip. You can even have your lights vary their color based on sunrise and sunset times.


## Quick-start guide (unfinished):
### While it is possible to use the Suleis platform with many different types of addressable LED strips, here is a tutorial to get your lights up and running quicky in our recomended configuration.
You will need the following
- Wemos D1 Mini
- Arduino Nano V3.0
- WS2811 LED Strip (and appropriate connector)
- 12V Power Suppy (and jack)
- Soldering tools
- Either our Suleis PCB (add link) or a breadboard and wires
